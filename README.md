# Story-Books
A social network for creating public and private stories.

This app uses a Google OAuth 2.0 strategy for authentication. Users can login and create stories which can be set to public or private. They can also choose if comments are allowed to be posted. I created a dashboard for users to manage their stories. I created helpers for authentication and access control as well as handlebars template helpers. I also prepared and deployed this app to Heroku.

Here is the link for the app - https://immense-mesa-29385.herokuapp.com/
